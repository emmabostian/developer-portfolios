## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### About Opening Links

- This script opens all links from README.md in your default browser
- Opening too many links at once may slow down your browser or cause it to crash
- We recommend opening no more than 50 links at a time
- Keep the links in a file based on how many you want to open. For example, if you want to open 30 links, just add 30 links to the file. If you want 50, add 50 links, and so on
- If your computer can handle more tabs, feel free to open more!

### Browser Tips

- Your browser might ask permission to open multiple tabs
- If your browser slows down, just close some tabs and try again
- This is completely normal - don't worry!

### Recommendation

Start with 50 tabs first. If your computer handles it well, you can try opening more next time.

### üéâ Have fun exploring all the amazing portfolios for inspiration!
